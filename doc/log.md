## Progress

#### 4.10.2024
We wrote a random graph generator that takes in a number of nodes and edges as input.
Once we get everything working, one thing that we would like to try is to generate chordal graphs.
This might not be necessary because we do run maximum cardinality search on it, but we'll see.
Chordality is a key characteristic to compiler interference graphs so we want to capture it as
accurate as possible.
